====================
nethserver-nextcloud
====================

This package can be installed before or after any user provider like nethserver-dc
and nethserver-directory.

If nethserver-dc or nethserver-directory are installed, the nethserver-nextcloud-save
event will automatically enable all local users.

The package does the following:

* create ``nextcloud`` mysql database
* create default database credentials: user `nextcloud` and password stored in ``/var/lib/nethserver/secrets/nextcloud``
* add trusted domains to use with web access
* create default credentials for web login: user `"admin"` and password `"Nethesis,1234"`
* set english as the default language
* set the user data directory as ``/var/lib/nethserver/nextcloud``

The configuration is stored inside the ``configuration`` db, under the ``nextcloud`` key. To show it: ::

 config show nextcloud

Properties:

* ``TrustedDomains``: list of trusted domains added to Nextcloud config file
* ``VirtualHost``: set custom virtual host, e.g. `mycloud.mydomain.it`
* ``Wellknown``: can be ``enabled` or ``disabled``. If enabled, add redirects for calDAV and cardDAV.
  This property doest have effect only if ``VirtualHost`` is empty.


Admin user
==========

After installation the application is accesible using the following credentials:

* User: admin
* Password: Nethesis,1234

Please, remember to change the default password after the first login!

Customize virtual host
======================

 config setprop nextcloud VirtualHost <VHOST>.<DOMAIN_NAME>
 config setprop nextcloud TrustedDomains <VHOST>.<DOMAIN_NAME>
 signal-event nethserver-nextcloud-update


Backup
======

The Nextcloud backup includes the configuration file and all data of the users: ::

 /var/lib/nethserver/nextcloud
 /usr/share/nextcloud/config/config.php

The database is automatically saved by ``nethserver-mysql``.
